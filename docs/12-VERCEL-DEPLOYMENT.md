# 12 · Cloud Deployment (Deploy to Vercel)

NextBlock ships a one-click **Deploy to Vercel** button (see the README) that brings
up a production instance already connected to a managed Supabase project. From there,
the in-app **First-Boot Setup Wizard** (`/setup`) finishes configuration in the
browser — there is no terminal step.

## How the button works

The badge links to `https://vercel.com/new/clone` with these query parameters:

| Parameter | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `repository-url` | The NextBlock repo to clone into the user's Git provider. |
| `project-name` / `repository-name` | Pre-fill the new Vercel project and Git repo names. |
| `stores=[{"type":"integration","integrationSlug":"supabase","productSlug":"supabase"}]` | Vercel's **native Supabase Marketplace integration**. During import you're prompted to **create a Supabase database** (name + region); Vercel **provisions it, connects it to the project, and injects the env vars before the first build**. |

There is deliberately **no `env=` parameter** — the deploy prompts for **zero** values you
have to type (see "No environment variables required" below). The only interaction is the
Supabase integration's "create database" step, which can't be skipped because provisioning
a Postgres DB requires choosing a region/plan.

> **Why `stores`, not `integration-ids`?** The legacy `integration-ids=oac_…` parameter
> triggers an OAuth integration that *creates* a Supabase project but leaves it
> **disconnected** — it injects **no** environment variables into the Vercel project, so
> the app boots unconfigured and you have to wire the keys up by hand. The modern `stores`
> parameter is the native Marketplace path that actually **connects the store and injects
> credentials before the build**. ([Vercel Deploy Button docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deploy-button/source))

## Connect the database (Supabase integration)

The `stores` parameter makes Vercel prompt you to create a Supabase database during import.
Pick a **name** and **region**, and Vercel **automatically injects** the integration's
environment variables into the project — you never copy a value. The native integration
injects the **new-style** Supabase key names, e.g.:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` /
`SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (the anon-equivalent), `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (the
service-role-equivalent), and `POSTGRES_URL` (+ the other `POSTGRES_*` parts).

NextBlock reads **all** of these aliases (see `apps/nextblock/lib/setup/env-status.ts`):
it accepts `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` *or* `SUPABASE_URL`; anon *or* `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`;
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` *or* `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`. So the wizard's connection step
auto-skips no matter which copy the integration set, and the browser client gets the
publishable key bridged in as the anon key at build time.

> If the database step still appears after a deploy that connected the store, the env vars
> landed **after** that build — **Redeploy** once (Vercel binds env vars at deploy time).
> With the `stores` flow they're injected *before* the first build, so this is rarely needed.

On that deploy the wizard skips the database-connection step, **auto-applies the schema**
(the migrations are embedded in the build — see `lib/setup/migrations-bundle.ts` — and run
via the injected `POSTGRES_URL`), uses the connected Supabase project for media storage,
and goes straight to creating the first administrator.

> Until the schema is applied and the first admin exists, **every route redirects to
> `/setup`** (the homepage does *not* 404). The middleware treats a "schema not applied yet"
> database error as *unprovisioned* and funnels traffic to the wizard.

## Build configuration (Nx monorepo)

NextBlock is an Nx monorepo — the Next.js app lives at `apps/nextblock`, not the repo
root — so a bare `next build` at the root fails with *"Couldn't find any `pages` or
`app` directory."* The root [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json) pins the correct build, so
the one-click deploy needs **no manual dashboard configuration**:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx nx build nextblock --prod",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/nextblock/.next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

- **`buildCommand`** runs the Nx target from the repo root, which resolves the
  workspace libraries (`@nextblock-cms/*` via the TS path aliases) and builds the app.
- **`outputDirectory`** points at the app's `.next`. This `@nx/next` version emits it
  to `apps/nextblock/.next` — **not** `dist/apps/nextblock/.next` (which only receives
  the deploy wrapper: `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `public/`). Verify with
  `npx nx build nextblock --prod` then check `apps/nextblock/.next/BUILD_ID`.
- **`framework: nextjs`** keeps Vercel's first-class Next.js runtime (SSR/ISR
  functions, image optimization, the `proxy.ts` middleware).

Leave the Vercel project's **Root Directory unset** (the repo root) — the build command
already targets the app. Do **not** set Root Directory to `apps/nextblock`: the app
imports the workspace libraries one level up, which a custom Root Directory would hide
(Vercel forbids `..` above a custom root).

## No environment variables required

A Deploy-Button URL can only carry variable **names**, never values — so secrets can
never be pre-filled through it. Rather than make you paste random strings, NextBlock
resolves everything in-app, and the button prompts for nothing:

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`** — optional. When unset the app falls back to Vercel's
  production URL (`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` server-side /
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` in the browser), i.e. your
  `*.vercel.app` domain. Sitemap, robots, and canonical links use it automatically.
  Add a custom domain later, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com` in the
  Vercel project, and redeploy (it is inlined at build time).
- **`DRAFT_MODE_SECRET`** and **`REVALIDATE_SECRET_TOKEN`** — optional. When unset they
  are derived deterministically from the Supabase service-role key (HMAC-SHA256), so
  Draft Mode and on-demand revalidation work out of the box. Setting either env var
  overrides the derived value — do this if you want a fixed `REVALIDATE_SECRET_TOKEN`
  to paste into a Supabase revalidation webhook. (See `apps/nextblock/lib/app-secrets.ts`.)
- **`CRON_SECRET`** — optional. The cron endpoints enforce the `Authorization: Bearer`
  header **only when it is set**. Leave it unset for a frictionless deploy, or set it
  in the Vercel project to lock the cron endpoints down. The destructive
  `/api/cron/reset-sandbox` job is independently gated to sandbox-mode only (404
  otherwise), so it never runs on a normal deploy.

## What the wizard does on Vercel

1. **Database** — already connected (integration-injected). The wizard verifies a
   first admin doesn't exist yet, otherwise it redirects to `/cms/dashboard`. The
   connection step is **auto-skipped**.
2. **Schema** — applied **automatically**. The Supabase integration creates the project
   but does **not** run NextBlock's migrations, so the wizard applies them itself on the
   final step: it runs the build-embedded migration bundle over the injected
   `POSTGRES_URL` (no CLI, no manual SQL). Idempotent — a re-run is a no-op. See
   [docs/04](./04-DATABASE-AND-AUTH.md) and [docs/05](./05-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md).
3. **Storage** — **skipped on Vercel; nothing to configure.** Media uses **native
   Supabase Storage** through the already-connected project: the injected
   `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` authenticates uploads/downloads/deletes via the Supabase client
   (no S3 access keys required), a public `media` bucket is auto-created, and images are
   served from `<project>/storage/v1/object/public/media/…`. The storage backend is
   selected automatically (`apps/nextblock/lib/storage/provider.ts`): if S3/R2 keys are
   present it uses them; otherwise it falls back to native Supabase Storage. (Cloudflare
   R2 remains the default for non-Vercel installs — it has a more generous free storage
   tier; set the `R2_*` env vars to use it on Vercel instead.)

   > **Upload size:** the CMS media uploader proxies the file through a serverless
   > function (`/api/upload/proxy`), which is subject to Vercel's ~4.5 MB request-body
   > limit — larger single images fail on the Hobby/Pro serverless runtime regardless of
   > storage backend. This is a platform constraint, not a NextBlock one.
4. **Email / Bot protection / Sign-ups** — optional steps; bot-protection and the
   sign-up policy persist to the database and work immediately. SMTP, if used, is set
   as Vercel environment variables.
5. **Administrator** — create the first admin. The account is created already
   confirmed (`email_confirm: true`), so no verification email is required.

> Filesystem is read-only on Vercel, so the wizard never writes `.env.local` there —
> all configuration is environment variables (platform-managed) plus the database.

## Cron jobs and the Hobby plan

`vercel.json` declares two crons (`/api/cron/reset-sandbox` at 03:00 and
`/api/cron/sync-currencies` at 18:00). Vercel's **Hobby (free) tier allows up to 100
cron jobs, each running at most once per day** — both jobs are daily, so they deploy
fine on the free tier. (Hobby timing is approximate, ±59 min, which is irrelevant for
daily jobs; only sub-daily schedules like `0 * * * *` are rejected on Hobby.)

`reset-sandbox` only does work in sandbox mode — it returns 404 otherwise — so on a
normal deploy it is a harmless no-op. Delete it from `vercel.json` if you'd rather not
see it scheduled.

## After deploy

Visit the deployment URL — it redirects to `/setup` until the first admin exists.
Complete the wizard, then sign in at `/cms/dashboard`.

**Automatic updates.** The 1-click deploy creates a **new repository you own** (a copy —
*not* a GitHub fork) and ships a daily upstream-sync GitHub Action. Because it's your own
repo, **Actions are enabled by default — there's nothing to turn on**; the workflow runs
once it's on your **default branch**, and the dashboard onboarding step completes
automatically when GitHub registers it. We recommend keeping the repo **public** (fully
zero-config); a **private** repo additionally needs a `NEXTBLOCK_GITHUB_TOKEN` env var for
the in-CMS conflict banner. (Only a *manually-created GitHub fork* has Actions disabled
until you enable them on the Actions tab.) Full details — both tracks, conflict handling,
and build-time migrations — are in [docs/13](./13-STAYING-UP-TO-DATE.md).
