# NextBlock CMS Documentation

This folder is the source-of-truth reference set for the NextBlock monorepo.
The numbered files are written from live code, routes, migrations, and shipped
library surfaces rather than historical planning notes.

## Audience Guide

- New contributors: read `01`, then `04`, then `05`.
- Commerce work: read `02`, then `04`.
- Editor or page-builder work: read `03`, then `07`.
- Custom block work: read `03`, then `10`.
- AI / Cortex work: read `08`.
- CLI or template work: read `06`.
- Publishing the libraries / scaffold CLI: read `06`.
- Running everything locally without cloud accounts: read `11`.
- One-click cloud deploy and the browser setup wizard: read `12`.
- AI agents: start with this index, then move directly to the subsystem file that
  matches the task. Treat `apps/nextblock`, `libs/*`, and
  `libs/db/src/supabase/migrations` as the final authority if a doc and code ever
  disagree.
- AI agents touching migrations must also read the root `AGENTS.md` note:
  production/shared database changes are append-only and non-destructive by
  default.
