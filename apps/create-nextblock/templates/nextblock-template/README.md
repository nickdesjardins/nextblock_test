# apps/nextblock

`apps/nextblock` is the canonical NextBlock™ application. It contains:

- the public site
- the authenticated CMS
- checkout and webhook routes
- cron routes
- the route tree used as the source for the scaffold template

If you are trying to understand current runtime behavior, start here before you
look at generated template output.
